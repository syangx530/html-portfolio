<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! Thanks for visiting my web development portfolio. I have 15+ years of experience teaching, consulting, and designing with a focus on academia. My B.A. is in Global Studies with a focus on economics and my M.S. is in the Management of Technology with a focus on business, technology, and leadership.</p>

<p>I have been an Instructional Designer and Academic Technologist for several years and I've started learning web design and programming to deeper my knowledge of technology to improve my current career skills and to hopefully obtain a deeper understanding of AI as it currently disrupts both the academic and business worlds.</p>
